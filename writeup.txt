##### PART 0 #####

	For reference, here is the Turkish alphabet, which we are using without any sort of
	transliteration for our grammar:

		AaBbCcÇçDdEeFfGgĞğHhIıİiJjKkLlMmNnOoÖöPpRrSsŞşTtUuÜüVvYyZz

	REMEDIAL CHANGES/ADDITIONS NOT ENTIRELY PERTINENT TO CURRENT ASSIGNMENT:

	1.	case [c], argument optionality [pro-d]

		Before editing the TDL files, we made some more changes to the case choices, grammar, 
		and testsuite.  Namely, we ensured that object drop is allowed for verbs with oblique 
		(non-accusative-case) objects, and disallowed for verbs with accusative-case objects. 
		We added several examples of verbs with oblique objects to the testsuite, including 
		examples of object drop.

		Some examples of a verb that takes dative-case objects, which do indeed receive 
		parses in the baseline grammar, including subject and object drop:

			### DAT object + DAT-TR (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {case}
			O				kadına			bayıldı
			O				kadın-a			bayıl-dı
			pronoun.3SG.NOM	woman.3SG-DAT	adore-PF.NPST.3SG
			'He/she/it adored the woman.'

			### DAT-TR SUBJECT DROP (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {argument optionality}
			Kadına			bayıldı
			Kadın-a			bayıl-dı
			woman.3SG-DAT	adore-PF.NPST.3SG
			'He/she/it adored the woman.'

			### DAT-TR OBJECT DROP (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {argument optionality}
			Bayıldı
			Bayıl-dı
			adore-PF.NPST.3SG
			'He/she/it adored.'

		Some examples of a verb that takes ablative-case objects, which do indeed receive 
		parses in the baseline grammar, including object drop:

			### ABL object + ABL-TR (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {case}
			O				kadından		korktu
			O				kadın-dan		kork-tu
			pronoun.3SG.NOM	woman.3SG-ABL	fear-PF.NPST.3SG
			'He/she/it feared the woman.'

			### ABL-TR OBJECT DROP (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {argument optionality}
			Korkuyor
			Kork-uyor
			fear-IMPF.NPST.3SG
			'He/she/it is afraid.'

		An example of a verb that takes locative-case objects, which does indeed receive a 
		parse in the baseline grammar:

			### LOC object + LOC-TR (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {case}
			O				evde			diretti
			O				ev-de			diret-ti
			pronoun.3SG.NOM	house.3SG-LOC	insist-PF.NPST.3SG
			'He/she/it insisted on the house.'

		Some examples of a verb that takes comitative-case objects (which can be marked either 
		by suffix or via postposition), which do indeed receive parses in the baseline grammar:

			### COM object + COM-TR (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {case}
			O				kediyle			ilgilendi
			O				kedi-yle		ilgilen-di
			pronoun.3SG.NOM	cat.3SG-COM		care-PF.NPST.3SG
			'He/she/it was interested in the cat.'

			### COM object + COM-TR (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {case, case-marking adpositions}
			O				kedi	ile			ilgilendi
			O				kedi	ile			ilgilen-di
			pronoun.3SG.NOM	cat.3SG	postpos.COM	care-PF.NPST.3SG
			'He/she/it was interested in the cat.'

		An ungrammatical example of a verb that takes accusative-case objects with would-be 
		object dropping, which indeed does NOT receive a parse in the baseline grammar:

			### ACC-TR OBJECT DROP (u) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: u
			Phenomena: {argument optionality}
			Gördü
			Gör-dü
			see-PF.NPST.3SG
			'He/she/it saw.'

		And, finally, an example of something ungrammatical that shouldn't parse but 
		incorrectly receives a parse anyway, with wacky semantics:

			### ABL object + DAT-TR (u) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: u
			Phenomena: {case}
			O				kadından		bayıldı
			O				kadın-dan		bayıl-dı
			pronoun.3SG.NOM	woman.3SG-ABL	adore-PF.NPST.3SG
			'He/she/it adored the woman.'

		The verb requires an object in the dative case, but because asyndetic coordination 
		doesn't restrict which cases can combine with which, the would-be subject and the 
		would-be object coordinate and the resultant phrase is apparently nominative (and 
		therefore interpreted as the subject of the verb), so the grammar interprets this 
		sentence as having no explicit object. Again, this should not be possible if 
		coordination were properly restricted only to combine Ns/NPs with matching (or 
		underspecified) case features.

		All we did in the customization system to allow for these examples was to create 
		new types of transitive verbs based on the required case features of their objects, 
		and give these types the features that their subjects be nominative, their objects 
		be whatever the type-specific case must be, and the OPT feature on the object a minus 
		value for accusative-object verbs and a plus for all oblique-object verbs.

	2.	cognitive status [cogst], determiners [det]

		Since definiteness / demonstrative determiners / cognitive status was the only cluster 
		of concepts not really covered in the testsuite prior to this lab, we went ahead and 
		added some related examples to the testsuite before gathering the baseline stats.

		We won't get into detail about the phenomena here, since they are explained in detail 
		below (including the examples from the testsuite), but they were indeed in the 
		testsuite at the time of the baseline coverage/overgeneration calcualtions.

	In general, we changed the particular lexical items in a lot of the testsuite examples 
	in order to have sentences with minimum ambiguity (i.e., we took out "mektubu," which 
	could be either the definite accusative or the nominative 3rd person possessum of 'book,'
	and replaced it with words like "hediyeyi," which is unambiguously the definite accusative 
	form of 'present').

	ADJECTIVAL AND ADVERBIAL MODIFIERS {adj, adv}

		1.	Description of linguistic facts

		Attributive adjectives in Turkish must precede the nouns they modify, but they have 
		flexible word order with regard to any quantifiers -- that is, nouns must be the final 
		element of the phrases they head, but attributive adjectives and quantifiers at the 
		front of the phrase are flexibly ordered among themselves.

		Attributive adjectives take no suffixes.  They do not have or need any agreement 
		features with the nouns they modify -- no number, no person, no case, nothing.

		In Turkish, adverbs of manner can appear before or after a saturated VP or at either 
		end of the sentence, suggesting that they can modify VPs and Ss but not Vs.

		2.	Examples from testsuite

		Here are some grammatical configurations of NPs including attributive adjectives:

			### BARE ADJ + NOUN (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {adjectives, word order}
			Güzel		kedi		gördüm
			Güzel		kedi		gör-dü-m
			beautiful	cat.3SG.ACC	see-PF.NPST-1SG
			'I saw a beautiful cat.'

			### DET + ADJ + NOUN (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {adjectives, determiners, word order}
			Bir		güzel		kedi		gördüm
			Bir		güzel		kedi		gör-dü-m
			a.SG	beautiful	cat.3SG.ACC	see-PF.NPST-1SG
			'I saw a beautiful cat.'

			### ADJ + DET + NOUN (g) ###
			# yeah, not gonna get parsed for now
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {adjectives, determiners, word order}
			Güzel		bir		kedi		gördüm
			Güzel		bir		kedi		gör-dü-m
			beautiful	a.SG	cat.3SG.ACC	see-PF.NPST-1SG
			'I saw a beautiful cat.'

		And here are some ungrammatical configurations of NPs including attributive adjectives:

			### BARE NOUN + ADJ (u) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: u
			Phenomena: {adjectives, word order}
			Kedi		güzel		gördüm
			Kedi		güzel		gör-dü-m
			cat.3SG.ACC	beautiful	see-PF.NPST-1SG
			'I saw a beautiful cat.'

			### DET + NOUN + ADJ (u) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: u
			Phenomena: {adjectives, word order}
			Bir		kedi		güzel		gördüm
			Bir		kedi		güzel		gör-dü-m
			a.SG	cat.3SG.ACC	beautiful	see-PF.NPST-1SG
			'I saw a beautiful cat.'

		Here are some examples of grammatical manner adverb usage at the edges of a 
		sentence:

			### ADV + SUBJ + VERB (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {adverbs, word order}
			Hızlı	ben					çıktım
			Hızlı	ben					çık-tı-m
			quickly	pronoun.1SG.NOM		exit-PF.NPST-1SG
			'I left quickly.'

			### SUBJ + VERB + ADV (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {adverbs, word order}
			Ben				çıktım				hızlı
			Ben				çık-tı-m			hızlı
			pronoun.1SG.NOM	exit-PF.NPST-1SG	quickly
			'I left quickly.'

		And here are some examples of grammatical manner adverb usage between the subject and
		the VP:

			### SUBJ + ADV + VERB (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {adverbs, word order}
			Ben				hızlı	çıktım
			Ben				hızlı	çık-tı-m
			pronoun.1SG.NOM	quickly	exit-PF.NPST-1SG
			'I quickly left.'

			### SUBJ + ADV + OBJ + VERB (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {adverbs, word order}
			Ben				hızlı	elma			yedim
			Ben				hızlı	seni			ye-di-m
			pronoun.1SG.NOM	quickly	apple.3SG.ACC	eat-PF-1SG
			'I quickly at the apple.'

		Finally, here is an ungrammatical example where the adverb intervenes between the 
		object/complement and the verb:

			### SUBJ + OBJ + ADV + VERB (u) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: u
			Phenomena: {adverbs, word order}
			Ben				elma			hızlı	yedim
			Ben				elma			hızlı	ye-di-m
			pronoun.1SG.NOM	apple.3SG.ACC	quickly	eat-PF-1SG
			'I quickly ate the apple.'
				
		3.	TDL snippets & descriptions

		Here are the types we defined for adverbs (the former taken verbatim from the 
		assignment instructions page) and added to turkish.tdl:

			> turkish.tdl

			adverb-lex := basic-adverb-lex & intersective-mod-lex &
			  [ SYNSEM [ LOCAL [ CAT [ HEAD.MOD < [ LOCAL.CAT.HEAD verb ]>,
						   VAL [ SPR < >,
							 SUBJ < >,
							 COMPS < >,
							 SPEC < > ]]]]].

			manner-adverb-adv-lex := adverb-lex.

		And here is the single adverbial lexical entry we added to lexicon.tdl:

			> lexicon.tdl

			hızlı := manner-adverb-adv-lex &
			  [ STEM < "hızlı" >,
			    SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_quickly_a_rel" ].

		Here is the rule we added to rules.tdl in order to allow adverbs to appear to the 
		right of the element being modified:

			> rules.tdl

			head-adj-int := head-adj-int-phrase.

		And here is the part of turkish.tdl, which was already present thanks to the 
		customization system, which ensured that the addition of the above rule would not 
		adversely affect adjective distribution (i.e., adjectives still can only appear to 
		the left of the element being modified), since attributive adjectives are defined 
		as POSTHEAD -:

			> turkish.tdl

			basic-adjective_attr-lex-rule := attr-adj-lex-rule & 
                                             basic-adjective_opt_cop-lex-rule-super &
			  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT [ VAL.SUBJ < >,
								   HEAD.PRD -,
								   POSTHEAD - ] ].

	AGREEMENT BETWEEN ADJECTIVES AND HEAD NOUN {adj, agr}

		Turkish does not have any notion of agreement between adjectives and head nouns.

	DEMONSTRATIVES AND/OR MARKERS OF DEFINITENESS {cogst}

		1.	Description of linguistic facts

		Turkish has an array of optional determiners that select for common nouns with agreeing
		number features (sg/pl, but possibly underpecified).  When there is a determiner in a 
		NP, it must precede the noun, and one can never appear with a determiner.

		The following are numerically-underspecified, definite determiners: her (every),
			bu (this), şu (this/that), o (that)

		The following is a plural, definite determiner: bütün (all)

		The following is the singular, indefinite determiner: bir (a/an)

		The following are plural, indefinite determiners: bazı (some), çok (many)

		Additionally, the overt accusative suffix actually doubles as a definiteness marker; 
		there is also a zero accusative suffix which denotes indefiniteness.

		2.	Examples from testsuite

		Examples of indefinite determiner usage with the indefinite accusative (grammatical) 
		and definite accusative (ungrammatical):

			### indef-det + indef-acc (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {cognitive status, determiners}
			Bir		mektup			okudum
			Bir		mektup			oku-du-m
			a.SG	letter.3SG.ACC	read-PF.NPST-1SG
			'I read a letter.'

			### indef-det + def-acc (u) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: u
			Phenomena: {cognitive status, determiners}
			Bir		mektubu			okudum
			Bir		mektub-u		oku-du-m
			a.SG	letter.3SG-ACC	read-PF.NPST-1SG
			'I read a letter.'

		Examples of indefinite and definite accusatives without determiners, with indefinite 
		and definite semantics nonetheless:

			### bare zero-acc (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {cognitive status}
			Mektup			okudum
			Mektup			oku-du-m
			letter.3SG.ACC	read-PF.NPST-1SG
			'I read a letter.'

			### bare zero-acc (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {cognitive status}
			Mektubu			okudum
			Mektub-u		oku-du-m
			letter.3SG-ACC	read-PF.NPST-1SG
			'I read the letter.'

		Examples of definite determiner usage with the indefinite accusative (ungrammatical) and 
		definite accusative (grammatical):

			### def-det + indef-acc (u) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: u
			Phenomena: {cognitive status, determiners}
			Bu		mektup			okudum
			Bu		mektup			oku-du-m
			this	letter.3SG.ACC	read-PF.NPST-1SG
			'I read a/this letter.'

			### def-det + def-acc (g) ###
			### proximal-demonstrative ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {cognitive status, determiners}
			Bu		mektubu			okudum
			Bu		mektub-u		oku-du-m
			this	letter.3SG-ACC	read-PF.NPST-1SG
			'I read this letter.'

		And finally, since the last two examples showed the proximal demonstrative determiner 
		"bu," here are some examples with the medial and distal determiners:

			### distal/hearer-demonstrative ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {cognitive status, determiners}
			Şu		mektubu			okudum
			Şu		mektub-u		oku-du-m
			this	letter.3SG-ACC	read-PF.NPST-1SG
			'I read this/that letter.'

			### distal/remote-demonstrative ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {cognitive status, determiners}
			O		mektubu			okudum
			O		mektub-u		oku-du-m
			that	letter.3SG-ACC	read-PF.NPST-1SG
			'I read that letter.'

		3.	TDL snippets & descriptions

		Here is the original code for determiners fr

		Here are the types (verbatim from the assignment instructions) we added to the Matrix 
		Type Addenda section of turkish.tdl:

			> turkish.tdl

			demonstrative_a_rel := predsort.
			proximal+dem_a_rel := demonstrative_a_rel. ; close to speaker
			distal+dem_a_rel := demonstrative_a_rel.   ; away from speaker
			remote+dem_a_rel := distal+dem_a_rel.      ; away from speaker and hearer
			hearer+dem_a_rel := distal+dem_a_rel.      ; near hearer

		Here is the lexical type defined in turkish.tdl in order to get around the current 
		version of basic-determiner-lex (verbatim from the assignment instructions except 
		for the additional specification of an empty MOD list to prevent determiners from 
		acting as modifiers):

			> turkish.tdl

			determiner-lex-supertype := norm-hook-lex-item & basic-zero-arg &
			  [ SYNSEM [ LOCAL [ CAT [ HEAD det & [ MOD < > ],
						   VAL [ SPEC.FIRST.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK [ INDEX #ind,
															  LTOP #larg ],
											SPR < >,
											SUBJ < >,
											COMPS < >] ],
						 CONT.HCONS < ! qeq &
							 [ HARG #harg,
							   LARG #larg ] ! > ], 
					 LKEYS.KEYREL quant-relation &
					   [ ARG0 #ind,
						 RSTR #harg ] ] ].

		Here are the types, originally from the customization system, which now inherit from 
		the new determiner-lex-supertype instead of from the originally given determiner-lex 
		(which in turn inherited from basic-determiner-lex):

			> turkish.tdl

			sgpl-definite-determiner-lex := determiner-lex-supertype & no-icons-lex-item.

			pl-definite-determiner-lex := determiner-lex-supertype & no-icons-lex-item &
			  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.VAL.SPEC.FIRST.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX.PNG.NUM pl ].

			sg-indefinite-determiner-lex := determiner-lex-supertype & no-icons-lex-item &
			  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.VAL.SPEC.FIRST.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX.PNG.NUM sg ].

			pl-indefinite-determiner-lex := determiner-lex-supertype & no-icons-lex-item &
			  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.VAL.SPEC.FIRST.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX.PNG.NUM pl ].

		And here are the subtypes thereof for demonstrative determiners and ordinary (non-
		demonstrative) determiners, respectively, also in turkish.tdl:

			> turkish.tdl

			demonstrative-determiner-lex := determiner-lex-supertype &
			  [ SYNSEM 
				 [ LKEYS.ALTKEYREL #evrel,
				   LOCAL [ CAT.VAL.SPEC.FIRST.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK [ INDEX #ind & [ COG-ST activ+fam ],
																LTOP #ltop ],
						   CONT.RELS <! [ PRED "exist_q_rel" ],
										#evrel & arg1-ev-relation & [ LBL #ltop, 
																	  ARG1 #ind ] !> ] ] ].

			ordinary-determiner-lex := determiner-lex-supertype & single-rel-lex-item.

		(Since lexical entries never inherit from these types without also inheriting from 
		one of the above definite/indefinite types, it is probably redundant to have these 
		types inherit from determiner-lex-supertype as well, but it also doesn't seem to have 
		any adverse effects to leave it in.)

		And of course the specific, multiply inheriting type (again, in turkish.tdl) that the 
		demonstrative determiners as declared in the lexicon most immediately inherit:

			> turkish.tdl

			demonstrative-sgpl-definite-determiner-lex := demonstrative-determiner-lex & 
			                                              sgpl-definite-determiner-lex.

		Finally, here are the lexical entries for the demonstrative determiners, with 
		appropriately adjusted PRED values and inherited types, in lexicon.tdl:

			> lexicon.tdl

			bu_4 := demonstrative-sgpl-definite-determiner-lex &
			  [ STEM < "bu" >,
				SYNSEM.LKEYS.ALTKEYREL.PRED proximal+dem_a_rel ].

			şu_4 := demonstrative-sgpl-definite-determiner-lex &
			  [ STEM < "şu" >,
				SYNSEM.LKEYS.ALTKEYREL.PRED hearer+dem_a_rel ].

			o_4 := demonstrative-sgpl-definite-determiner-lex &
			  [ STEM < "o" >,
				SYNSEM.LKEYS.ALTKEYREL.PRED remote+dem_a_rel ].

		4.	Problems encountered

	ARGUMENT OPTIONALITY {pro-d}

		1.	Description of linguistic facts

		Because Turkish is a pro-drop language, the subject is always optional. Person and
		number agreement inflection is required on the verb regardless. Objects of VPs cannot
		be dropped.

		***I believe the interpretation is always that the subject, if dropped, is in-focus

		2.	Examples from testsuite

		Examples of argument optionality, first showing the explicit subject for reference:

			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {word order}
			Kadın           çıktı
			Kadın           çık-tı
			woman.3SG.NOM   exit-PF.3SG
			'The woman left.'

			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {word order}
			Kadın			evi				gördü
			Kadın			ev-i			gör-dü
			woman.3SG.NOM	house.3SG-ACC	see-PF.3SG
			'The woman saw the house.'

		...and then remembering, of course, that the subject is optional:

			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {argument optionality}
			Çıktı
			Çık-tı
			exit-PF.3SG
			'He/she/it left.'

			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {argument optionality}
			Evi				gördü
			Ev-i			gör-dü
			house.3SG-ACC	see-PF.3SG
			'He/she/it saw the house.'

		The first example follows all other rules implemented in our grammar and includes the
		verb's subject. The second example follows all other grammar rules but excludes the
		subject of the verb. All contain the required agreement feature on the verb (zero
		for 3rd person singular).

		This example does not parse (since it cannot recognize the NOM-marked noun as an object
		and therefore lacks an object, which cannot be dropped) but should because accusative
		optionality:

			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {word order}
			Kadın			gördü
			Kadın			gör-dü
			woman.3SG.NOM	see-PF.3SG
			'He/she/it saw the woman.'

		3.	TDL snippets & descriptions

		4.	Problems encountered

	POSSESSIVES {poss}

		1.	Description of linguistic facts

		Turkish allows for an optional possessor (which must have genitive case) on either 
		(left or right) edge of the NP, along with a required (head noun) possessee that must 
		be inflected with a possessive suffix whose number and person features agree with those 
		of the possessor.

		2.	Examples from testsuite

		Here are a few examples of possession as they currently exist in our grammar:

			### 1SG, with genitive ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {possessives}
			Benim			ailem					geldi
			benim			aile-m					gel-di
			pronoun.1SG.GEN	family.3SG.NOM-POSS.1SG	come-PF.3SG
			'My family arrived.'

		This example doesn't currently parse although it should. This is due to the genitive
		case not being active in our grammar as it is. Some rule must allow genitive case
		nouns to be processed as determiners.

			### 1SG, without genitive ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {possessives}
			Ailem					geldi
			Aile-m					gel-di
			family.3SG.NOM-POSS.1SG	come-PF.3SG
			'My family arrived.'

		This sentence currently parses in our grammar; however, the possessive suffix is
		semantically empty.

			### 1SG, without possessive ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: u
			Phenomena: {possessives}
			Benim			aile			geldi
			benim			aile			gel-di
			pronoun.1SG.GEN	family.3SG.NOM	come-PF.3SG
			'My family arrived.'

		This sentence is ungrammatical because the subject does not carry the possessive suffix.
		But it does not parse because of the presence of the genitive (i.e., it is treated as
		ungrammatical for the wrong reason).

	OTHER

		Coordination was adding way too many parses, so I commented out all of the many, many
		coordination and coordination agreement rules in rules.tdl, e.g.,

			> rules.tdl

			;n1-1st-any-1st-any-any-pl-top-coord := n1-1st-any-1st-any-any-pl-top-coord-rule.
			(...)
			;s4-bottom-coord := s4-bottom-coord-rule.
