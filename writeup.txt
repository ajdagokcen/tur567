##### PART 0 #####

	For reference, here is the Turkish alphabet, which we are using without any sort of
	transliteration for our grammar:

		AaBbCcÇçDdEeFfGgĞğHhIıİiJjKkLlMmNnOoÖöPpRrSsŞşTtUuÜüVvYyZz

	REMEDIAL CHANGES/ADDITIONS NOT ENTIRELY PERTINENT TO CURRENT ASSIGNMENT:

	1.	case [c], argument optionality [pro-d]

		Before editing the TDL files, we made some final changes 

		-	pronominal examples to effectively demonstrate that subjects can't be accusative
		-	accusative now has indefinite -0 morph and definite -I morph
		-	added in comitative/instrumental ("-(y)lA") case, because...
		-	added verbs that take (optional) dative, ablative, locative, and comitative 
			oblique objects
		-	did not have time yet to add examples into testsuite; efforts ongoing

	2.	tense aspect mood [tam], negation [neg], agreement [agr] (morphology)

		-	made tense morphemes impart a finite form feature as well, with a sister -0 rule 
			that imparts a non-finite form feature
		-	also just noting that the phonological generation would be really hard to make 
			rules to get around (we tried) because there are usually a MINIMUM of four 
			allomorphs, plus some stem changes :(
			-	we could change the suffixes and testsuite so only one version of each suffix 
				is included and the rest is left to phonology, but Ajda doesn't want to do that 
				because the superficial lack of vowel harmony makes her sad and she prefers 
				overgenerating to that

	1.	matrix yes-no questions [q]

		Turkish employs an interrogative auxiliary to form matrix yes-no questions.  This 
		auxiliary follows its VP complement, raises the subject (which it requires to be 
		nominative, as do all verbs), and requires that the complement be non-finite (meaning 
		it may be inflected for negation and aspect, but not for tense or agreement).

		The auxiliary itself cannot take negation or aspect morphemes, and must be inflected 
		for tense and subject agreement (i.e., it must be finite).  The tense and agreement 
		suffixes are the same as they are for any non-auxiliary verb.

		However, matrix yes-no questions which draw focus to certain arguments use the 
		interrogative marker as an uninflected particle instead, appearing immediately after 
		the element that is being focused.

		Here are some examples of properly finite interrogative auxiliaries with non-finite 
		VP complements:

			### IMPF comp, NPST+3SG aux (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {matrix yes-no questions}
			Kadın			çıkıyor			mu
			Kadın			çık-ıyor		mu
			woman.3SG.NOM	exit-IMPF		question.NPST.3SG
			'Is the woman leaving?'

			### IMPF comp, PST+3SG aux (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {matrix yes-no questions}
			Kadın			çıkıyor			muydu
			Kadın			çık-ıyor		mu-ydu
			woman.3SG.NOM	exit-IMPF		question-PST.3SG
			'Was the woman leaving?'

		And here are some ungrammatical examples where the auxiliary has an aspect suffix and 
		the VP complement is finite, respectively:

			### _ comp, IMPF+NPST+3SG aux (u) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: u
			Phenomena: {matrix yes-no questions}
			Kadın			çık		mııyor
			Kadın			çık		mı-ıyor
			woman.3SG.NOM	exit	question-IMPF.NPST.3SG
			'Is the woman leaving?'

			### IMPF+PST+3SG comp, _ aux (u) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: u
			Phenomena: {matrix yes-no questions}
			Kadın			çıkıyordu				mu
			Kadın			çık-ıyor-du				mu
			woman.3SG.NOM	exit-IMPF-PST.3SG		question
			'Is the woman leaving?'

		Finally, here is an example of the question marker instead acting as a particle and 
		appearing directly after the focused argument under question:

			### questioning subject (g) ###
			# unclear whether tense+person is actually on the auxiliary in this case?
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {matrix yes-no questions, word order}
			Kadın			mı			çıkıyor
			Kadın			mı			çık-ıyor
			woman.3SG.NOM	question	exit-IMPF.NPST.3SG
			'Is it the woman who is leaving?'

		Since interrogative auxiliaries are not given as an option for yes-no question 
		formation in the customization quite, we did not select any of the options in 
		the Matrix Yes-No Questions section.

		Instead, we added an auxiliary verb "mi" to the lexicon and simply left it as 
		being semantically empty.  We specified that it requires a non-finite complement 
		and a nominative subject, and we added it as a possible input to the tense/
		finiteness position class that otherwise applies to aspect-inflected verbs.

		We (reluctantly) adjusted the negation/tense/aspect/mood/agreement rules for verbs 
		so that they're all optional, because otherwise we couldn't figure out a way to 
		ensure that a VP complement of an auxiliary CANNOT be finite, but the highest verb 
		(final auxiliary or matrix verb without an auxiliary) MUST be finite, and the 
		interrogative auxiliary CANNOT take negation or aspect suffixes, but other verbs 
		MUST take negation and aspect suffixes.  We made sure to carefully specify which 
		words and rules could apply to one another, but only making all of the affixes 
		optional resulted in the yes-no questions actually parsing in the end.  Hopefully 
		in tdl editing we will be able to define more specifically when morphological 
		rules are obligatory and when they aren't -- and without having to define separate, 
		otherwise-redundant morphological rules to do so.

		As for the argument focusing particle phenomenon, this does not fall in the realm 
		of the particle described in the Matrix Yes-No Questions section, nor is it 
		otherwise within the scope of the customization suite to describe, so this facet of 
		question formation remains unaccounted for in the grammar.

	2.	matrix wh questions [wh]

		Turkish allows matrix wh questions to be formed without any changes to word order 
		or employment of auxiliaries; all that need be done is to use a wh pronoun (with 
		the proper case feature) as the subject or object, exactly as one would use a 
		regular 3rd person pronoun.

		Here is an example of a matrix wh question where the questioned argument is the 
		subject:

			### NOM WH-SUBJECT (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {matrix wh questions}
			Kim			çıktı
			Kim			çık-tı
			who.3SG.NOM	exit-PF.NPST.3SG
			'Who left?'

		And here is an example of a matrix wh question where the questioned argument is 
		the object:

			### ACC WH-OBJECT (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {matrix wh questions, argument optionality}
			Ne				gördün
			Ne				gör-dü-n
			what.3SG.ACC	see-PF.NPST-2SG
			'What did you see?'

		And finally, an ungrammatical example where the would-be wh pronoun subject is 
		in the incorrect case:

			### DAT WH-SUBJECT (u) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: u
			Phenomena: {matrix wh questions}
			Kime		çıktı
			Kime		çık-tı
			who.3SG.DAT	exit-PF.NPST.3SG
			'Who left?'

		Since the customization suite does not include a way to implement wh question 
		formation, we didn't do much in that regard to account for these phenomena.

		As a temporary holdover to at least allow the sentences to parse, we added all of 
		the declined case forms of the wh-pronouns "ne" ('what') and "kim" ('who') as 
		possible 3rd person (sg & pl) pronouns, since they effectively act as such for most 
		intents and purposes (agreement and the like).  There is no way in the customization 
		suite for these wh pronouns to make the sentence interrogative; perhaps in tdl editing 
		we will be able to specify these semantics, though I'm not sure what the features for 
		wh questions (as opposed to yes-no questions) we would be aiming for.

	3.	coordination [crd]

		Coordination in Turkish can be expressed either via asyndeton, where one simply 
		lists all coordinands with no conjunctions between them, or via monosyndeton, where 
		there is a conjunction prior to the final coordinand.  This applies to elements 
		of all types (N, NP, VP, S, etc.).

		There is a restriction, however, that either (a) all coordinands have the exact 
		same morphological rules applied to them, or that (b) all non-final coordinands omit 
		the same inflection suffixes across the board (and the values of the missing features 
		are given to be those of the final, obligatorily inflected coordinand).  This latter 
		phenomenon is often referred to as "suspended affixation."

		For verb phrases, if the non-final coordinands omit all inflection, they must take the 
		coordination suffix -ip (and all tense/aspect/mood, negation, and agreement features 
		will still be equivalent to the inflectionally-supplied features of the final 
		coordinand).

		Here are some examples of asyndeton:

			### len=2 N/NP asyndeton (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {coordination}
			Elma			armut			yedim
			Elma			armut			ye-di-m

			pronoun.1SG.NOM	come-PF.NPST-1SG	exit-PF.NPST-1SG
			'I arrived and left.'

		And some examples of monosyndeton:

			### len=2 N/NP mono/polysyndeton (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {coordination}
			Elma			ve	armut			yedim

			Ben				gel-di-m			ve	çık-tı-m
			pronoun.1SG.NOM	come-PF.NPST-1SG	and	exit-PF.NPST-1SG
			'I arrived and left.'

		An ungrammatical example of omnisyndeton:

			### len=2 N/NP omnisyndeton (u) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: u
			Phenomena: {coordination}
			Ve	elma			ve	armut			yedim
			Ve	elma			ve	armut			ye-di-m
			and	apple.3SG.ACC	and	pear.3SG.ACC	eat-PF.NPST-1SG
			'I ate an apple and (a) pear.'

		An ungrammatical example of coordinands with clashing morphology:

			### ACC+DAT (u) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: u
			Phenomena: {coordination}
			Elma			ve	armuda			yedim
			Elma			ve	armud-a			ye-di-m
			apple.3SG.ACC	and	pear.3SG-DAT	eat-PF.NPST-1SG
			'I ate an apple and (a) pear.'

		And some examples of suspended affixation:

			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {coordination}
			Ben				geldi				ve	çıktım
			Ben				gel-di				ve	çık-tı-m
			pronoun.1SG.NOM	come-PF.NPST		and	exit-PF.NPST-1SG
			'I arrived and left.'

			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {coordination}
			Ben				gelip				çıktım
			Ben				gel-ip				çık-tı-m
			pronoun.1SG.NOM	come-CONV		exit-PF.NPST-1SG
			'I arrived and left.'

		In the Coordination section of the customization suite, we added both asyndeton and 
		monosyndeton strategies, splitting up the strategies further so that there are 
		asyndeton and monosyndeton strategies for Ns and NPs (which then get agreement 
		patterns) and separate asyndeton and monosyndeton strategies for VPs and Ss.

		In both monosyndeton strategies, we said that the pattern is marked by a word that 
		comes after the coordinand, and that word is the basic conjunction "ve" ('and').

	4.	coordination agreement [crdagr]

		In Turkish, 

		Here are some examples of coordinated NPs where one of the coordinands has the 1st 
		person feature, and so the resultant phrase is 1st person and plural:

			### 3SG+1SG subj, 1PL agreement (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {coordination agreement}
			O				ve	ben				çıktık
			O				ve	ben				çık-tı-k
			pronoun.3SG.NOM	ve	pronoun.1SG.NOM	exit-PF.NPST-1PL
			'He/she/it and I left.'

			### 1SG+2SG subj, 1PL agreement (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {coordination agreement}
			Ben				ve	sen				çıktık
			Ben				ve	sen				çık-tı-k
			pronoun.1SG.NOM	ve	pronoun.2SG.NOM	exit-PF.NPST-1PL
			'You (sg) and I left.'

		Here are some examples where one of the coordinands has the 2nd person feature, and 
		none of the others have the 1st person feature, so the resultant phrase is 2nd person 
		and plural:

			### 3SG+2SG subj, 2PL agreement (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {coordination agreement}
			O				ve	sen				çıktınız
			O				ve	sen				çık-tı-nız
			pronoun.3SG.NOM	ve	pronoun.2SG.NOM	exit-PF.NPST-2PL
			'He/she/it and you left.'

			### 2SG+3SG subj, 2PL agreement (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {coordination agreement}
			Sen				ve	o				çıktınız
			Sen				ve	o				çık-tı-nız
			pronoun.2SG.NOM	ve	pronoun.3SG.NOM	exit-PF.NPST-2PL
			'He/she/it and you left.'

		Here is an example of all 3rd person coordinands resulting in a 3PL phrase:

			### 3SG+3SG subj, 3PL agreement (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {coordination}
			Kadın			ve	kedi			çıktılar
			Kadın			ve	kedi			çık-tı-lar
			woman.3SG.NOM	ve	kedi.3SG.NOM	exit-PF.NPST-3PL
			'The woman and the cat left.'

		And finally, some examples of incorrect agreement patterns:

			### 2SG+1SG subj, 2PL agreement (u) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {coordination agreement}
			Sen				ve	ben				çıktınız
			Sen				ve	ben				çık-tı-nız
			pronoun.2SG.NOM	ve	pronoun.1SG.NOM	exit-PF.NPST-2PL
			'You (sg) and I left.'

			### 3SG+2SG subj, 3PL agreement (u) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: u
			Phenomena: {coordination agreement}
			O				ve	sen				çıktılar
			O				ve	sen				çık-tı-lar
			pronoun.3SG.NOM	ve	pronoun.2SG.NOM	exit-PF.NPST-3PL
			'He/she/it and you left.'

			### 3SG+3SG subj, 1PL agreement (u) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: u
			Phenomena: {coordination}
			Kadın			ve	kedi			çıktık
			Kadın			ve	kedi			çık-tı-k
			woman.3SG.NOM	ve	kedi.3SG.NOM	exit-PF.NPST-1PL
			'The woman and the cat left.'

		In the Agreement Features in Coordinated Phrases part of the Coordination section 
		of the customization suite, we created one Feature Resolution agreement pattern that 
		we then applied to both the asyndeton and monosyndeton strategies of N/NP 
		coordination.  In this we specified that any coordinated NP parent has a plural count 
		feature, for one.  Regarding person features, we specified that a 1st person coordinand 
		followed by anything OR anything followed by a 1st person coordinand results in a 1st 
		person parent; that a 2nd person coordinand followed or preceded by anything but a 1st 
		person coordinand results in a 2nd person parent; and that combinations of 3rd person 
		coordinands result in a 3rd person parent.

		We did not see a way to restrict case in coordinated NPs such that only Ns and NPs 
		with the same case suffixes may be coordinated (let alone to allow nouns to omit 
		case suffixes if and only if they are non-final coordinands), so we did not include 
		case features in our agreement patterns.

	5.	adjectives [adj]

		Attributive adjectives in Turkish must precede the nouns they modify, but they have 
		flexible word order with regard to any quantifiers -- that is, nouns must be the final 
		element of the phrases they head, but attributive adjectives and quantifiers at the 
		front of the phrase are flexibly ordered among themselves.

		Attributive adjectives take no suffixes.  They do not have or need any agreement 
		features with the nouns they modify -- no number, no person, no case, nothing.

		Here are some grammatical configurations of NPs including attributive adjectives:

			### BARE ADJ + NOUN (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {adjectives, word order}
			Güzel		kedi		gördüm
			Güzel		kedi		gör-dü-m
			beautiful	cat.3SG.ACC	see-PF.NPST-1SG
			'I saw a beautiful cat.'

			### DET + ADJ + NOUN (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {adjectives, determiners, word order}
			Bir		güzel		kedi		gördüm
			Bir		güzel		kedi		gör-dü-m
			a.SG	beautiful	cat.3SG.ACC	see-PF.NPST-1SG
			'I saw a beautiful cat.'

			### ADJ + DET + NOUN (g) ###
			# yeah, not gonna get parsed for now
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {adjectives, determiners, word order}
			Güzel		bir		kedi		gördüm
			Güzel		bir		kedi		gör-dü-m
			beautiful	a.SG	cat.3SG.ACC	see-PF.NPST-1SG
			'I saw a beautiful cat.'

		And here are some ungrammatical configurations of NPs including attributive adjectives:

			### BARE NOUN + ADJ (u) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: u
			Phenomena: {adjectives, word order}
			Kedi		güzel		gördüm
			Kedi		güzel		gör-dü-m
			cat.3SG.ACC	beautiful	see-PF.NPST-1SG
			'I saw a beautiful cat.'

			### DET + NOUN + ADJ (u) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: u
			Phenomena: {adjectives, word order}
			Bir		kedi		güzel		gördüm
			Bir		kedi		güzel		gör-dü-m
			a.SG	cat.3SG.ACC	beautiful	see-PF.NPST-1SG
			'I saw a beautiful cat.'

		In the Adjective part of the Lexicon section of the customization suite, we specified 
		a basic type of adjective that can act as a predicate on its own, via copula, or act 
		attributively.

		Additionally, in the Morphology section, this required that we include morphological 
		rules that determine which role a given instance of an adjective is taking.  All three 
		of these happen to be zero suffixes, so we specified them as such.  It's worth noting 
		that while the customization automatically made two rules based on the optionality 
		of copulas for predicative adjectives, it did not automatically create a rule for 
		licensing attributive adjectives and behaved oddly until we added such a rule, without 
		making it clear that the lack of attributive-licensing morphological rule was the 
		problem.

	6.	adverbs [adv]

		In Turkish, adverbs of manner can appear before or after a saturated VP or at either 
		end of the sentence, suggesting that they can modify VPs and Ss but not Vs.

		Here are some examples of grammatical manner adverb usage at the edges of a 
		sentence:

			### ADV + SUBJ + VERB (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {adverbs, word order}
			Hızlı	ben					çıktım
			Hızlı	ben					çık-tı-m
			quickly	pronoun.1SG.NOM		exit-PF.NPST-1SG
			'I left quickly.'

			### SUBJ + VERB + ADV (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {adverbs, word order}
			Ben				çıktım				hızlı
			Ben				çık-tı-m			hızlı
			pronoun.1SG.NOM	exit-PF.NPST-1SG	quickly
			'I left quickly.'

		And here are some examples of grammatical manner adverb usage between the subject and
		the VP:

			### SUBJ + ADV + VERB (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {adverbs, word order}
			Ben				hızlı	çıktım
			Ben				hızlı	çık-tı-m
			pronoun.1SG.NOM	quickly	exit-PF.NPST-1SG
			'I quickly left.'

			### SUBJ + ADV + OBJ + VERB (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {adverbs, word order}
			Ben				hızlı	elma			yedim
			Ben				hızlı	seni			ye-di-m
			pronoun.1SG.NOM	quickly	apple.3SG.ACC	eat-PF-1SG
			'I quickly at the apple.'

		Finally, here is an ungrammatical example where the adverb intervenes between the 
		object/complement and the verb:

			### SUBJ + OBJ + ADV + VERB (u) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: u
			Phenomena: {adverbs, word order}
			Ben				elma			hızlı	yedim
			Ben				elma			hızlı	ye-di-m
			pronoun.1SG.NOM	apple.3SG.ACC	quickly	eat-PF-1SG
			'I quickly ate the apple.'
				
		Since the customization suite does not include a way to implement adverbs,
		we did not do anything in the questionnaire to account for these phenomena.

	7.	embedded declaratives [emb-d]

		Finite embedded declaratives are a little tricky in Turkish because non-finite 
		complements are much preferred, but the former still does exist.  These can occur 
		as complements of verbs like "düşünmek" ('think') or "demek" ('say').

		No complementizer is needed if the matrix verb is "demek."  Otherwise, the 
		complementizer "ki" licenses the sentential complement after the matrix verb, while 
		the complementizer "diye" licenses the sentential complement before.

		Here's an example of a quotative construction where no complementizer is needed:

			### no complementizer (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {embedded declaratives}
			Kedi		uyudu				diyorlar
			Kedi		uyu-du				d-iyor-lar
			cat.3SG.NOM	sleep-PF.NPST.3SG	say-IMPF.NPST-3PL
			"They're saying (that) the cat slept."

		Here are examples of properly ordered constructions with "diye" and "ki" 
		complementizers:

			### diye-complementizer before verb (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {embedded declaratives, word order}
			Kedi		uyudu				diye	köpek		düşünür
			Kedi		uyu-du				diye	köpek		düşün-ür
			cat.3SG.NOM	sleep-PF.NPST.3SG	that	dog.3SG.NOM	think-HAB.NPST.3SG
			"The dog thinks that the cat slept."

			### ki-complementizer after verb (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {embedded declaratives, word order}
			Köpek		düşünür				ki		kedi		uyudu
			Köpek		düşün-ür			ki		kedi		uyu-du
			dog.3SG.NOM	think-HAB.NPST.3SG	that	cat.3SG.NOM	sleep-PF.NPST.3SG
			"The dog thinks that the cat slept."

		And here are examples of improperly ordered constructions with "diye" and "ki" 
		complementizers:

			### diye-complementizer after verb (u) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: u
			Phenomena: {embedded declaratives, word order}
			Köpek		düşünür				diye	kedi		uyudu
			Köpek		düşün-ür			diye	kedi		uyu-du
			dog.3SG.NOM	think-HAB.NPST.3SG	that	cat.3SG.NOM	sleep-PF.NPST.3SG
			"The dog thinks that the cat slept."

			### ki-complementizer before verb (u) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: u
			Phenomena: {embedded declaratives, word order}
			Kedi		uyudu				ki		köpek		düşünür
			Kedi		uyu-du				ki		köpek		düşün-ür
			cat.3SG.NOM	sleep-PF.NPST.3SG	that	dog.3SG.NOM	think-HAB.NPST.3SG
			"The dog thinks that the cat slept."

		Non-finite participle complements, meanwhile, are formed by suffixing a verb with 
		-dIk, allowing it to combine with its complement if it has one, and then treating it 
		as a noun.  In this form, the subject is expressed through a genitive-possessive 
		construction, with a possessive suffix on the verbal and an optional genitive agreeing 
		with the possessive suffix in person and number.  The verbal also takes case suffixes.

		Here is an example of such a verbal noun / participle complement construction:

			### verbal noun / participle (g) ###

			"I didn't know (that) you played the piano."

		Since the customization suite does not include a way to implement embedded 
		declaratives, we did not do anything in the questionnaire to account for these 
		phenomena.

	8.	embedded interrogatives [emb-q]

		Embedded interrogatives are pretty rare in Turkish, but as long as they're in a 
		quotation-like context, they can occur as complements of the verb "demek" ('say'), 
		or with the complementizer "diye."  They cannot occur with the complement "ki,"
		regardless of the word order.

		Here's an example of a quotative construction where no complementizer is needed:

			### no complementizer (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {embedded interrogatives}
			Kedi		uyudu				mu					diyorlar
			Kedi		uyu-du				mu					d-iyor-lar
			cat.3SG.NOM	sleep-PF.NPST.3SG	question.NPST.3SG	say-IMPF.NPST-3PL
			"They're asking, did the cat sleep?"

		Here is an example with the complementizer "diye":

			### diye-complementizer after verb (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {embedded interrogatives}
			Kedi		uyudu		mu					diye	sordu
			Kedi		uyu-du		mu					diye	sor-du
			cat.3SG.NOM	sleep-PF	question.NPST.3SG	that	ask-PF.NPST.3SG
			"They're asking, did the cat sleep?"

		And here is an ungrammatical example with the complementizer "ki" (order irrelevant):

			### ki-complementizer after verb (u) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: u
			Phenomena: {embedded declaratives}
			Köpek		düşünür				ki		kedi		uyudu		mu
			Köpek		düşün-ür			ki		kedi		uyu-du		mu
			dog.3SG.NOM	think-HAB.NPST.3SG	that	cat.3SG.NOM	sleep-PF	question.NPST.3SG
			"The dog wonders whether the cat slept."

		Since the customization suite does not include a way to implement embedded 
		interrogatives, we did not do anything in the questionnaire to account for these 
		phenomena.

	9.	non-verbal predicates [cop]

		Adjectives and NPs can act as predicates in Turkish, with or without a copula.  If 
		there is no copula, then the adjective or noun must take tense and agreement suffixes, 
		just as a normal verb does (but, importantly, these non-verbal predicates cannot take 
		negation or aspect suffixes).  If there is a copula, then the adjective or noun 
		must remain non-finite, and the copula must be finite.

		There are two copulas.  One copula is a to-be verb "ol" that must be used if one wishes 
		to introduce aspect to a non-verbal predicate.  This copula can and must take all of the 
		suffixes of a normal verb.  The other is the negative copula "değil," which has an 
		inherent negation feature and must take tense and agreement suffixes but cannot take 
		negation or aspect suffixes.

		Here are examples of predicative adjectives and nouns without copulas:

			### FINITE ADJ + NO-COP (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {non-verbal predicates}
			Ben				mutluyum
			Ben				mutlu-yum
			pronoun.1SG.NOM	happy.NPST-1SG
			"I am happy."

			### FINITE NOUN + NO-COP (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {non-verbal predicates}
			Ben				oğrenciyim
			Ben				oğrenci-yim
			pronoun.1SG.NOM	student.NPST-1SG
			"I am a student."

		Here are examples of predicative adjectives and nouns with copulas:

			### NON-FINITE ADJ + POS-COP (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {non-verbal predicates}
			Ben				mutlu	olurum
			Ben				mutlu	ol-ur-um
			pronoun.1SG.NOM	happy	be-HAB.NPST-1SG
			"I am happy."

			### NON-FINITE NOUN + POS-COP (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {non-verbal predicates}
			Ben				oğrenci	değilim
			Ben				oğrenci	değil-im
			pronoun.1SG.NOM	student	neg.NPST-1SG
			"I am not a student."

		And here are ungrammatical examples where there are neither copulas nor finite 
		suffixes on the nouns and adjectives:

			### NON-FINITE ADJ + NO-COP (u) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: u
			Phenomena: {non-verbal predicates}
			Ben				mutlu
			Ben				mutlu
			pronoun.1SG.NOM	happy
			"I am happy."

			### NON-FINITE NOUN + NO-COP (u) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: u
			Phenomena: {non-verbal predicates}
			Ben				oğrenci
			Ben				oğrenci
			pronoun.1SG.NOM	student
			"I am a student."

		In the Adjective part of the Lexicon section of the customization suite, we specified 
		a basic type of adjective that can act as a predicate on its own, via copula, or act 
		attributively.  This required saying that predicative adjectives could OPTIONALLY 
		appear as complements of a copula.

		Additionally, in the Morphology section, this required that we include morphological 
		rules that determine which role a given instance of an adjective is taking.  All three 
		of these happen to be zero suffixes, so we specified them as such.

		The negative copula and copula-less predicative adjectives we specified as requiring 
		tense and agreement suffixes and being unable to take negation and aspect suffixes, 
		while the other copula takes all of the suffixes of a regular verb.  The copulas, 
		of course, require their complements (adjectives) to be non-finite.

		Predicative nouns are not accounted for in the customization suite, so we did not 
		do anything in that regard.

##### PART 3 #####
#	Descriptions of any properties of your language illustrated in your test suite but not
#	covered by your starter grammar and/or the customization system.

	As described above, the semantics of wh-questions, suspended affixation in coordinated
	phrases, the flexible word order of attributive adjectives with regard to quantifiers, 
	anything to do with adverbs, embedded declaratives, embedded interrogatives, and 
	nominal predicates (copular and otherwise) are all illustrated in our testsuite but 
	not accounted for by our grammar.

	In addition, we tried to account for the notion that the topmost copula/auxiliary (or the 
	predicate/verb itself if there are no copulas/auxiliaries) must be finite while all 
	verbs/predicates/auxiliaries/copulas that are complements of others must be non-finite, 
	but the interaction of "in this case these suffixes are required and in this case they 
	are disallowed" proved too difficult for us to implement in the customization suite.

##### PART 4 #####
#	Documentation the coverage of your grammar over the testsuite. This should include both
#	summary numbers, which you can get by using the Analyze | Coverage and Analyze |
#	Overgeneration options in [incr tsdb()], and discussion of specific examples. If there are
#	examples that thare parsed incorrectly (unanalyzed grammatical examples, analyzed
#	ungrammatical examples, or grammatical examples assigned surprising parses), reflect on why
#	that might be.

	1.	Coverage & Overgeneration

		Coverage:

			Positive Items #:		97
			Total Results #:		73
			Word String 0:			3.16
			Lexical Items 0:		8.10
			Distinct Analyses 0:	11.23
			Overall Coverage %:		75.3

		Overgeneration:

			Negative Items #:		58
			Total Results #:		13
			Word String 0:			2.86
			Lexical Items 0:		8.34
			Distinct Analyses 0:	13.08
			Overall Coverage %:		22.4

		The majority of the parses for this lab produces more than one analysis. Some produced 
		few and some produced many. We believe that we can account for most analyses with the 
		rules that we have incorporated in the grammar; however, some of these analyses were 
		unexpected at first. 

	2.	Surprising Parses: Subject Dropping Object Dropping SUBJ-HEAD
		
		We were surpised to see three tree structures that brought the two NPs and the VP 
		gether. These parses are affected by other phenomena that are seen below, but primarily 
		are the result of subject and object dropping in Turkish that we have modeled in our 
		grammar. 
		
		This sentence produced 51 parses:
		
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {word order}
			Gördü		kadın			evi
			Gör-dü		kadın			ev-i
			see-PF.3SG	woman.3SG.NOM	house.3SG-ACC
			'The woman saw the house.'
			
		The three tree structures that resulted from this sentence, as well as others, are 
		licensed by the HEAD-SUBJ rule, the DECL-HEAD-OPT-SUBJ rule, and the 
		BASIC-HEAD-OPT-COMP rule. 
		
		When the HEAD-SUBJ rule is in effect, the verb combines with the subject of the 
		sentence. Other ambiguity- causing phenomena can affect whether the verb takes one of 
		the nouns as a complement or not, but this is addressed in the coordination section 
		below. 
		
		When the OPT-SUBJ or OPT-COMP rule are in effect, the two nouns form the individual 
		parts of a coordinated phrase. This means that the transitive verb is missing one of 
		it's arguments: the subject or the object. However, Turkih allows for argument 
		optionality for both subject and object. Therefore, although these parses were not 
		initially anticipated, they are reasonable and grammatical.

	3.	Surprising Parses: Coordination
		
		We introduced coordination to our grammar this week and allowed asyndeton as grammatical.
		This, in conjunction with other rules, allowed for some overgeneration. However, in 
		isolation, the coordination rule generated several analyses for single sentences. 
		
		This sentence produced 27 parses, many of which were caused by our coordination rule:

			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {determiners}
			Her			kadın			mektubu			okudu
			Her			kadın			mektub-u		oku-du
			every.SG	woman.3SG.NOM	letter.3SG-ACC	read-PF.3SG
			'Every woman read the letter.'
			
		Allowing asyndeton coordination enables our grammar to parse the NN sequence, which 
		should be processed as subject object, as two parts of a coordinated phrase. In this 
		given example, the coordination rule in conjunction with the optionality of the subject 
		create a case where both the woman and the letter are being read by a dropped subject 
		in addition to the expected analysis that the woman reads the letter. For this 
		analysis, there must also be some changes in case, which problem is addressed below. 

	4.	Things That Should've Parsed But Didn't: Yes-No Questions and Non-Verbal Predicates

		Matrix yes-no questions and non-verbal predicates don't currently parse, though they 
		ought to.  Some examples of sentences that should receive parses but don't:

			### IMPF comp, NPST+3SG aux (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {matrix yes-no questions}
			Kadın			çıkıyor			mu
			Kadın			çık-ıyor		mu
			woman.3SG.NOM	exit-IMPF		question.NPST.3SG
			'Is the woman leaving?'

			### FINITE ADJ + NO-COP (g) ###
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {non-verbal predicates}
			Ben				mutluyum
			Ben				mutlu-yum
			pronoun.1SG.NOM	happy.NPST-1SG
			"I am happy."

		The reason for this is that all morphological rules are required for all verbs and 
		predicative adjectives in the current grammar, but in fact some need to be forbidden 
		when a predicate is acting as a complement to a copula or auxiliary.

		We tried getting around this by making everything optional, but the result was about 
		800 parses for some of the sentences.  Not a worthy tradeoff.

	5.	Rampant Ambiguity (and resultant overgeneration)

		Our grammar features two cases for the subject of a sentence with a transitive verb: 
		nominative and accusative. However, because the accusative marker doubles as the 
		indefinite marker for subjects, there are two rules that license accusative CASE. The 
		rule that causes the multiple analyses is the zero-marking accusative rule that is meant 
		to allow indefinite subjects to be accusative in CASE. This is an expected analysis, 
		however, we were surprised by the parses at first. 
		
		This sentence produced 51 parses by our grammar: 
		
			Source: author
			Vetted: f
			Judgment: g
			Phenomena: {case}
			Kadın			mektubu			okudu
			Kadın			mektub-u		oku-du
			woman.3SG.NOM	letter.3SG-ACC	read-PF.3SG
			'The woman read the letter.'
		
		First, the Zero-marking Accusative Lexical Rule allows for subjects of transitive verbs 
		that would be nominative in CASE when definite, to be accusative when indefinite. This 
		means that in any sentence with a transitive verb, there will be one parse for a 
		subject with CASE accusative and one with CASE nominative. The number of analyses is 
		compounded as multiple analyses as a result of other phenomena occur because for each 
		analysis, there must be one for accusative and one for definite CASE. 
		
		Secondly, our grammar currently allows free word order. This means that both the 
		subject and the object of a sentence with a transitive verb get a chance to be 
		processed as the subject--both definite (CASE accusative) and indefinite (CASE 
		nominative)--and the object.

##### PART 5 #####
#	Finally, if there are any places where the customization system seems unable to cope with
#	the properties of your language (within the phenomena addressed in this lab), describe them
#	here.

	The main sticking points for handling the Turkish phenomena in this lab:

		1.	The interrogative auxiliary!  It's interesting that yes-no questions are so rarely 
			formed with auxiliaries, cross-linguistically.  If languages use interrogative 
			particles you'd think interrogative auxiliaries wouldn't be too far off from that. 
			In any case, the lack of option for interrogative auxiliaries in yes-no question 
			formation meant that we had to implement a semantically empty auxiliary instead.

		2.	Conditional morphological obligatoriness and suspended affixation!  The complex 
			interplay of some verbs/predicates requiring certain suffixes while others forbid 
			them, and the omission of some affixes from VP complements of auxiliaries, all while 
			the suffixes are identical when they are applied in various situations in which they 
			are required.... There sure was no easy way to account for this, going through the 
			customization suite.  Making a bunch of redundant lexical rules was untenable and 
			might not have even solved the problems.
